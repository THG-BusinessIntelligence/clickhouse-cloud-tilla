-- Hourly Scheduled Query for Campaign Performance Updates
-- =====================================================
-- Schedule: Every hour
-- Processing Window: Last 2 hours (1-hour overlap for late events)
-- Method: MERGE with deduplication using GREATEST()
-- Estimated Cost: ~$0.0013 per run (~$11/year)
