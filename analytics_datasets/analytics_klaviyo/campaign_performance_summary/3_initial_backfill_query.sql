-- =====================================================
-- Initial Backfill Query for Campaign Performance
-- =====================================================
-- Purpose: One-time historical data load (last 30 days)
-- Estimated Cost: ~$0.50-1.88 depending on data volume
-- Run this ONCE after creating the table
-- =====================================================

-- This query loads the last 30 days of campaign performance data
-- After this, the hourly scheduled query will maintain the table
